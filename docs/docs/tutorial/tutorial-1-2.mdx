As our friend reached Pamplona, a creature appeared before him: Lerna's Hydra. The Hydra was a one-headed monster that when it's head was cut off, 2 more heads grew in its place.

Camundonaut reached for a sword and cut off the head of the beast. As a result 2 more appeared. He cut both heads off, which doubled to 4. How many heads would the beast have after cutting them for 5 times?

```
// We could try to represent this in a multiplication like this:
2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

//But we can leverage exponentiation and represent it like this:
2 ** 5
```

By the 5th time, there were 32 heads and Camundonaut had no way out, thankfully the heads started fighting with each other and he was able to escape.

<LiveFeel
  defaultExpression={dedent`
    // leverage exponentiation to represent the multiplications
    2 ** 5`}
