Once Zee arrived to Pamplona, a mystical creature appeared: Lerna's Hydra. :snake: The Hydra was a
one-headed monster that when it's head was cut off, 2 more heads would grew in its place.

Zee reached for a sword :dagger_knife: and cut off the head of the beast. As a result 2 more
appeared. :scream: Zee cut both heads off again, which doubled to 4. How many heads would the beast
have after cutting them for 5 times?

We could try to represent this in a multiplication like this: `2*2*2*2*2`, but we can leverage
[exponentiation](/docs/reference/language-guide/feel-numeric-expressions.md#exponentiation) and
represent it like the following expression:

<LiveFeel
  defaultExpression={dedent`
    // use exponentiation to represent the multiplications
    2*2*2*2*2`}
  feelContext='{"base": 2, "exponent": 5}'
  metadata={{ page: "tutorial-1-2" }}
/>

      By the 5th time, there were 32 heads and no apparent way out, thankfully the heads started
      fighting with each other and Zee was able to escape.
