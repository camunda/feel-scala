Before he continues on his quest, Zee promised to keep in touch with friends back home and send them
each a letter. :incoming_envelope:

Luckily, FEEL [string expressions](/docs/reference/language-guide/feel-string-expressions.md) are
here to Help and save time. Use an expression to fill the name on the envelope that contains the
first and the last name.

<EnvelopeAddress
  defaultExpression={dedent`
      // concatenate the first and the last name
      firstName`}
  feelContext='{"firstName":"?", "lastName":"?"}'
  metadata={{ page: "tutorial-2-1" }}
/>
