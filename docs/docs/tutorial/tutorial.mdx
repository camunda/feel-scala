The tutorial is created as part of our Camunda Summer Hack Days project 2022.

It may be incomplete, wrong, or broken. But stay tuned for updates!

Welcome to our tutorial :wave:

We'll do our best to guide you through the different capabilities
of [FEEL](/docs/reference/what-is-feel.md) and hopefully make the
process fun :tada:

We are enlisting you to help us guide our friend "Zee" to complete a quest from Spain to Berlin in
time for CamundaCon (2022). With the use of FEEL we'll be able to help in the journey.

Before we start, let's say "Hi" to Zee:

![Zee](/img/zee.png)

Use the interactive editor below to evaluate the
[FEEL expression](/docs/reference/language-guide/feel-expressions-introduction.md) and greet Zee.

<LiveFeel
    defaultExpression={dedent`
    "Hello Zee"
    `}
    metadata={{ page: "tutorial-the-quest-begins" }}
/>

:::note
FEEL is an expression language. Compared to script languages or other complex programming
languages, an expression language evaluates only a single expression.

Zee is happy to have you on board. So, let the journey begin :rocket:
