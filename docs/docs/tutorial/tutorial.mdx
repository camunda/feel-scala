The tutorial is created as part of our Camunda Summer Hack Days project 2022.

It may be incomplete, wrong, or broken. But stay tuned for updates!

Welcome to our tutorial :wave:

We'll do our best to guide you through the different capabilities
of [FEEL](/docs/reference/what-is-feel.md) and hopefully make the
process fun :tada:

We are enlisting you to help us guide our friend "Zee" to complete a quest from Spain :es: to Berlin
:de: in time for CamundaCon (2022). With the use of FEEL we'll be able to help in the journey.

Before we start, let's say "Hi" to Zee:

![Zee](/img/zee.png)

Use the interactive editor below to evaluate the
[FEEL expression](/docs/reference/language-guide/feel-expressions-introduction.md) and greet Zee.

<LiveFeel
    defaultExpression={dedent`
    "Hello Zee"
    `}
    metadata={{ page: "tutorial-the-quest-begins" }}
/>

:::note
FEEL is an expression language. Compared to script languages or other complex programming
languages, an expression language evaluates only a single expression.

Zee is happy to have you on board. So, let the journey begin :rocket:
