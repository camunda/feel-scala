Zee is now entering France :fr: and during the battle with Hydra lost the Boots of Hermes. It is
7:00 AM and our friend has to continue by foot :walking: The goal is to walk to Lyon which is
729.1 kms distance.

Considering average walking speed is 5 km/h how many days would Zee need to walk without taking many
rest?, and at what time would Zee reach Lyon?

First determine the number of days using expressions were already used `distance / speed`.
In this case: `729.1 / 5 = 145 hrs`. To determine arrival time, we can leverage modular clock
(24 hours) arithmetics using the function [modulo()](/docs/reference/builtin-functions/feel-built-in-functions-numeric.md#modulo).

<LiveFeel
  defaultExpression={dedent`
    // using a 24 hour clock
    modulo((hours + startingHour), modulus)`}
  feelContext='{"startingHour": 7, "hours": 145, "modulus": 24}'
  metadata={{ page: "tutorial-1-2" }}

      Zee would take 6 days to arrive and would be there at 8:00 AM.
