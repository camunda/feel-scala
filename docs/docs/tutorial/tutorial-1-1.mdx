import dedent from "dedent";

Let's start our quest :triangular_flag_on_post: FEEL allows you to use basic
[numeric calculations](/docs/reference/language-guide/feel-numeric-expressions.md) like addition,
subtraction and multiplication to name a few. Our friend arrived in Spain by boat, specifically
Cadiz. The goal is to reach Pamplona (which is 1,030.8 kms away).

As part of the quest, Zee received magical items :sparkles: and decided to use The Boots of Hermes
:shoe:, which give its wearer a speed of 48.2 kms/hour.

Using numeric operators, how many hours would it take to get there? Consider resting for 30 minutes
every 5 hours. Let's also round up the number for total resting time by using a
[numeric function](/docs/reference/builtin-functions/feel-built-in-functions-numeric.md).

<LiveFeel
  defaultExpression={dedent`
      // Formula considering resting time plus total time
      round up(restInHrs * (distance / speed) / restInterval + distance / speed, 0)`}
  feelContext='{"distance": 1030.8, "speed": 48.2, "restInHrs": 0.5, "restInterval": 5}'
