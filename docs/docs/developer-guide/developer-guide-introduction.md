You can embed the FEEL engine in your application in different ways. Have a look
at [Bootstrapping](bootstrapping.md) to see how.

Afterward, you can extend and customize the FEEL engine by implementing one of the following
SPIs (Service Provider Interface):

* [Function Provider SPI](function-provider-spi.md)
* [Value Mapper SPI](value-mapper-spi.md)
* [Clock SPI](feel-engine-clock-spi.md)
