Everything starts with the [Data Types](./feel-data-types.md). Read this first to have a better
understanding of the other content.

If you're writing an expression for an input entry of a decision table then have a look
at [Unary-Tests](./feel-unary-tests.md).

Otherwise, have a look at the more general section
about [Expressions](./feel-expressions-introduction.md).

If you're just looking for a function to call then go directly
to [Built-in Functions](../builtin-functions/feel-built-in-functions-introduction.md).
