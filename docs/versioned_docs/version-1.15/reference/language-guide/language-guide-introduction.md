Everything begins with [data types](./feel-data-types.md). Read on this subject first to have a better
understanding of the other content like [expressions](./feel-expressions-introduction.md) and [built-in functions](./feel-functions.md).

If you're writing an expression for an input entry of a decision table, visit our documentation on [unary-tests](./feel-unary-tests.md).

Otherwise, have a look at the more general section
about [expressions](./feel-expressions-introduction.md).

Looking for a function to call? Visit our documentation on [built-in functions](../builtin-functions/feel-built-in-functions-introduction.md).
