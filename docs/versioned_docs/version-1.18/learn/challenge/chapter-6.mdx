Zee took a short rest and continued walking to CamundaCon. :de: On the road, he passed mountains,
fields, and woods. :mountain: :deciduous_tree: After a few days, he realized that he walked in cycles.
:dizzy_face: Unsure about right way, he looks at the trail markers. :large_red_square:
:large_blue_circle: :large_orange_diamond:

Can you help him to choose the right way to Berlin?
