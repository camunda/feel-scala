Let's start our quest. :triangular_flag_on_post: FEEL allows you to use basic
[numeric calculations](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/language-guide/feel-numeric-expressions/) like addition,
subtraction and multiplication to name a few. Our friend arrived in Spain by boat, specifically
Cadiz. The goal is to reach Pamplona (which is 1,030.8 kms away).

As part of the quest, Zee received magical items :sparkles: and decided to use The Boots of Hermes
:shoe:, which give its wearer a speed of 48.2 kms/hour.

Using numeric operators, how many hours would it take to get there? Consider resting for 30 minutes
every 5 hours. Let's also round up the number for total resting time by using a
[numeric function](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/builtin-functions/feel-built-in-functions-numeric/).

<LiveFeel
  defaultExpression={dedent`
      // change formula considering resting time plus total time
      round up(distance / speed, 0)`}
  feelContext='{"distance": 1030.8, "speed": 48.2, "restInHrs": 0.5, "restInterval": 5}'
  metadata={{ page: "challenge-1" }}

      It would take Zee 24 hours to complete the trip.

      round up(restInHrs * (distance / speed) / restInterval + distance / speed, 0)
