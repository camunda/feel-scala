Welcome to our challenge. :wave:

We'll do our best to guide you through the different capabilities
of [FEEL](/docs/reference/what-is-feel.md) and hopefully make the
process fun. :tada:

We are enlisting you to help us guide our friend "Zee" to complete a quest from Spain :es: to Berlin
:de: in time for CamundaCon (2022). With the use of FEEL we'll be able to help in the journey.

Before we start, let's say "Hi" to Zee:

![Zee](/img/zee.png)

Use the interactive editor below to evaluate the
[FEEL expression](/docs/reference/language-guide/feel-expressions-introduction.md) and greet Zee.

<LiveFeel
    defaultExpression={dedent`
    "Hello Zee"
    `}
    metadata={{ page: "challenge-0" }}
/>

Zee is happy to have you on board. So, let the journey begin. :rocket:
