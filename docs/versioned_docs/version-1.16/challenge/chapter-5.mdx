The next stop would put Zee in Cologne :de:, as the journey continued there was an important
question to answer: would Zee get in time for the conference? :watch:

The trip started on September 15th, 2022, and since the journey began, around 200 hours had passed.
CamundaCon will start on October 5th, 2022.

Let's use [temporal operators](/docs/reference/language-guide/feel-temporal-expressions.md) to check
how many days Zee has left:

<LiveFeel
  defaultExpression={dedent`
    // use temporal math to calculate the remaining days
    date(startingDate) + duration("PT200H")`}
    feelContext='{"startingDate": "2022-09-15", "targetDate": "2022-10-05"}'
  metadata={{ page: "challenge-5" }}
/>

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Zee has 11 days to arrive in Berlin.
    </div>
    <br />
    <pre title={'Expression'}>
      (date(targetDate) - date(startingDate) - duration("PT200H")) / duration("P1D")
    </pre>
  </div>
</details>
