You want to learn FEEL? Great. :tada:

If you're looking for **example** FEEL expressions to solve common problems, check out the following
examples:

- [Temporal expressions](samples/temporal-samples.md)
- [List expressions](samples/list-samples.md)
- [Context expressions](samples/context-samples.md)

If you want to **test** your knowledge, take a look at the [challenge](challenge/challenge.mdx).

If you want to know more about FEEL in general and how to **write** FEEL expressions, see the 
[lanugage guide](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel/).
