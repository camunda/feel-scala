Welcome to the documentation of the FEEL-Scala engine!

If you're **new** and don't know anything about FEEL then have a look
at [What is FEEL](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel/) first.

If you want to know how to **write** FEEL expressions then have a look at
the following pages of the language guide:
- [Data types](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/language-guide/feel-data-types/)
- [Expressions](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/language-guide/feel-expressions-introduction/)
- [Unary-tests](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/language-guide/feel-unary-tests/)
- [Built-in functions](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/builtin-functions/feel-built-in-functions-introduction/)

If you want to **integrate** the FEEL engine in your application then have a look at
the [Developer Guide](./developer-guide/function-provider-spi.md).

If you want to **try out** your FEEL expressions in development then check out the
[Playground](/docs/playground) (online or local).
