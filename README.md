[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.camunda.feel/feel-engine/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.camunda.feel/feel-engine)

A parser and interpreter for FEEL which is written in Scala (see [What is FEEL?](https://camunda.github.io/feel-scala/what-is-feel)).

It is integrated in the DMN Engine of the Camunda BPM Platform. However, it can also be used outside
of Camunda BPM as a native Scala application or script engine.

**Features:** :sparkles:

* full support for unary-tests and expressions (DMN 1.2)
* including built-in functions
* extensible by own functions and custom object mappers

## Install

different methods of usage can be found [here](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/tree/master/feel-engine#usage).
